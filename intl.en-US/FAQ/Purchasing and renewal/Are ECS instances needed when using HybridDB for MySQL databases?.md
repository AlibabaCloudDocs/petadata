# Are ECS instances needed when using HybridDB for MySQL databases? {#concept_vf5_ssk_x2b .concept}

By default, HybridDB for MySQL supports only one internal IP address. You cannot access HybridDB for MySQL directly over the public network, and have to use an ECS application or client to access HybridDB for MySQL. You can request a public IP address in the console to access HybridDB for MySQL over the public network. However, the public network is complex and out of the access control of Alibaba Cloud. The performance may be poor when you use a public IP address to access HybridDB for MySQL.
