# Monitoring

HybridDB for MySQL provides monitoring and alarm information of instances. You can query the instance performance metrics to analyze the instances usage, collect business trend statistics, and locate and diagnose instance problems.

-   The metric data is collected every 5 minutes.
-   You can only query the metric data of the last 30 days.

1.  Log on to the [HybridDB for MySQL console](https://petadata.console.aliyun.com/) to go to the **Instances** page.
2.  In the upper-left corner of the console, select the **region** where the instance is located.
3.  Click the instance **ID**, or click **Manage** next to the required instance to enter the Basic Information page.
4.  In the left-side navigation pane, click Monitoring and Alarms to enter the Monitoring tab page.

    On the Monitoring tab page, you can specify the **Group**, **Metrics**, and **Time Range** to filter the monitoring results.
