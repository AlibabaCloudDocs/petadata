# Use RAM for resource authorization {#concept_zjw_jw4_mfb .concept}

The instances you create using your Alibaba Cloud account are resources owned by the account. By default, an account owner has full access to its own resources.

By using Resource Access Management \(RAM\), you can grant access to resources owned by the Alibaba Cloud account to RAM users.

**Note:** If you do not need to use RAM, skip this section.
